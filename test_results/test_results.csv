0,5,1,a,Multiple choice,Null,Which of the following machine learning methods that can be used for unsupervised learning? Select one or more alternatives. 1. PCA. 2. Bayesian linear regression. 3. Logistic regression. 4. Random forest. 5. Variational auto-encoder. 6. Clustering,"1. PCA, 5. Variational auto-encoder, 6. Clustering","The correct answers are:

* **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to find a lower-dimensional representation of data. It is commonly used for unsupervised learning as it doesn't require any labelled data. 

* **Variational auto-encoder**: A Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) is a generative model that learns a compressed representation of the input data. It is an unsupervised learning method as it doesn't rely on labelled data.

* **Clustering**: Clustering is a class of unsupervised learning techniques that aims to group similar data points together.  Popular clustering algorithms include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **Bayesian linear regression**: This is a supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between input variables and output variables. 

* **Logistic regression**: This is also a supervised learning technique used for classification. It aims to predict the probability of a data point belonging to a certain class.

* **Random forest**: This is a supervised learning technique used for classification and regression. It is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

Therefore, the correct answers are **1, 5, and 6**."

**Explanation of Line 13-14:**

The importance sampler works by drawing samples from a proposal distribution, $q(x)$, and then weighting them by the ratio of the target distribution, $p(x)$, to the proposal distribution. This ratio is known as the importance weight:

$$w_i = \frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$$

In this case, the proposal distribution is the standard normal distribution, $q(x) = \mathcal{N}(x; 0, 1)$, and the target distribution is the truncated normal distribution, $p(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{F(b)} \mathcal{N}(x; 0, 1) & \text{if } x < b \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$.

**Line 13-14 calculates the importance weights as follows:**

```python
weights = np.where(samples < b, 1 / proposal_dist.pdf(samples), 0)
```

- `np.where(samples < b, ... , 0)`: This line checks which samples are within the truncation range ($x < b$). For samples that are within the range, the weight is calculated; for samples outside the range, the weight is set to zero.
- `1 / proposal_dist.pdf(samples)`: This line calculates the reciprocal of the probability density of the proposal distribution evaluated at the sampled values. This is because the target distribution is the standard normal distribution scaled by $1/F(b)$ within the truncation range, meaning that $p(x) = \frac{1}{F(b)}q(x)$ for $x < b$. Therefore, the importance weight is:

$$w_i = \frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)} = \frac{\frac{1}{F(b)}q(x_i)}{q(x_i)} = \frac{1}{F(b)}$$

- `weights /= np.sum(weights)`: This line normalizes the weights so that they sum to one, ensuring that the weighted samples accurately represent the target distribution.

In essence, line 13-14 effectively scales the weights of the samples within the truncation range by the factor $\frac{1}{F(b)}$, ensuring that the importance sampler correctly samples from the truncated normal distribution.

**Reason for Poor Performance:**

When the truncation threshold `b` is set to -4, the target distribution becomes highly concentrated in the left tail of the standard normal distribution.  This means the proposal distribution (standard normal) is a poor match for the target distribution. The majority of samples from the proposal distribution will be in regions where the target distribution has very low probability density. Consequently:

- **Low Importance Weights:** Most samples will have very small weights because the ratio of the target distribution to the proposal distribution will be extremely low in those regions.
- **Inefficient Sampling:**  The importance sampler will primarily pick samples from the proposal distribution's tails, leading to a biased estimate of the target distribution.

**Improvement without Using More Samples:**

The key to improving the performance is to choose a proposal distribution that better matches the target distribution. Here's how:

1. **Shift the Proposal Distribution:** Instead of using the standard normal distribution (mean 0), shift the proposal distribution to a mean closer to the truncation point `b`. For example, use a proposal distribution with mean `-4` and a standard deviation of 1:

   ```python
   proposal_dist = norm(loc=-4, scale=1)
   ```

2. **Adjust Variance (Optional):** If the target distribution is very narrow around the truncation point, consider reducing the variance of the proposal distribution. This will make the proposal distribution more concentrated in the region where the target distribution has higher probability density.

**Explanation of the Improvement:**

- Shifting the proposal distribution's mean closer to the truncation point aligns the peak of the proposal distribution with the region of higher probability density in the target distribution. This increases the importance weights for samples drawn from this region, leading to more accurate estimates.
- Adjusting the variance allows for finer control over the shape of the proposal distribution, making it even more closely match the target distribution.

By modifying the proposal distribution to better reflect the target distribution, the importance sampler can overcome the issues caused by the truncation point and produce more accurate samples.

This aligns the peak of the proposal distribution with the region where the target distribution has higher probability density. This significantly improves the performance of the importance sampler.

2. **Weight Calculation:**
   - The `weights` are calculated as before, ensuring that samples outside the truncation range receive zero weight.

3. **Sampling from Weighted Samples:**
   - The `sampled_indices` are chosen according to the calculated weights, ensuring that samples with higher weights are selected more often, reflecting the target distribution.

4. **Plotting the Distributions:**
   - We generate a histogram of the weighted samples, using `weights=np.ones_like(samples) / len(samples)` to normalize the weights. This provides a visual representation of the estimated target distribution based on the importance sampling.
   - The exact target distribution is calculated using the formula for the truncated normal distribution and plotted alongside the histogram. 

**Output:**

The plot will show the estimated distribution, which should closely resemble the exact target distribution. The improved importance sampler now effectively samples from the truncated normal distribution, even with the challenging truncation point at `b=-4`.

17,5,4,e,Multiple choice,Null,Which of the following statements are true for the Gibbs sampler. 1. We need to be able to sample from all conditional distributions of the target distribution. 2. We need to be able to evaluate the target distriubtion up to a proportional constant. 3. We need to discard the samples during the so called burn in period. 4. The samples need to be weighted.,Alternative 1 and 3. are correct for the Gibbs sampler.,"Here's a breakdown of the statements about the Gibbs sampler and their truthfulness:

**1. We need to be able to sample from all conditional distributions of the target distribution.** 

**True.** The Gibbs sampler works by iteratively sampling from the conditional distributions of each variable given the current values of all other variables.  This means you need a way to generate random samples from each of these conditional distributions.

**2. We need to be able to evaluate the target distribution up to a proportional constant.**

**True.**  The Gibbs sampler doesn't require knowing the exact normalization constant of the target distribution. You only need to be able to evaluate the target distribution up to a constant factor. This is because the normalization constant cancels out during the sampling process.

**3. We need to discard the samples during the so-called burn-in period.**

**True.** The Gibbs sampler often starts in an arbitrary state. The initial samples may not reflect the true distribution of the target.  The burn-in period is used to allow the sampler to converge to the stationary distribution. Samples taken during this period are typically discarded.

**4. The samples need to be weighted.**

**False.** The Gibbs sampler produces samples that are directly from the target distribution. Unlike methods like importance sampling, there's no need to weight the samples. The Gibbs sampler inherently generates samples according to the desired probability distribution.

**In Summary:**

The Gibbs sampler requires the ability to sample from the conditional distributions of the target distribution and the ability to evaluate the target distribution up to a constant. It also typically involves a burn-in period where initial samples are discarded.  The samples themselves do not need to be weighted.
