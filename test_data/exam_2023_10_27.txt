2, 1, "Multiple choice", "Please answer the following questions regarding Bayesian inference $p(x|y)=\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$. Which of the following is usually the most challenging to compute? Select one alternative. 1. The likelihood $p(y|x)$. 2. The prioc p(x). 3. The marginal likelihood p(y). "
2, 1, "Multiple choice", "How do we typically choose the prior distribution $p(x)$? Select one alternative. 1. Depending on the application, based on the domain/expert knowledge. 2. Depending on the application, but we can always conveniently choose Gaussian. 3. If we know that x must be negative, then we can choose the prior p(x) to be a Beta distribution."
2, 1, "Multiple choice", "What does $\int_0^1 p(x|y)dx$ mean? Select one alternative. 1. The probability of the event $x \in [0, 1]$ conditioned on $y$. 2. The posterior distribution evaluated at points 0 and 1. 3. The marginal likelihood $p(y)$."

2, 1, "Essay", "Explain the key differences between supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Provide examples of real-world applications for each type of problem. Use maximum 200 words."

2, 1, "Multiple choice", "Consider $y=w^2x+\cos(w)x+\epsilon$, where w is a number, $x \sim \mathcal{N}(1,1^2)$ and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.01^2)$ which is independent of $x$. What is the expected value $E[y]$? Select one alternative. 1. $E[w]x+E[\cos(w)]x$. 2. $w^2x+\cos(w)x$. 3. $w^2+\cos(w)+\epsilon$ 4. $w^2+\cos(w)$"
2, 1, "Multiple choice", "Consider $y=w^2x+\cos(w)x+\epsilon$, where w is a number, $x \sim \mathcal{N}(1,1^2)$ and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.01^2)$ which is independent of $x$. What is the covariance $\cov{x,y}$? Select one alternative. 1. $w^2 + \cos(w)$. 2. $w^2xy+\cos(w)xy$. 3. 0. 4. 0.1."
2, 1, "Multiple choice", "Consider $y=w^2x+\cos(w)x+\epsilon$, where w is a number, $x \sim \mathcal{N}(1,1^2)$ and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.01^2)$ which is independent of $x$. Suppose that $\epsilon$ is not independent of $x$, but jointly Gaussian distributed with $x$. Is the posterior distribution $p(x|y)$ still Gaussian? Select one alternative. 1. Yes. 2. No."


2, 3, "Essay", "Let $X \sim p(x)$ be a random variable following a density $p(x)=\frac{1}{Z}e^{(-x\tanh(x^3))}$ where $Z$ is an unknown constant. Your task is to compute the expectation $E[e^{(-X^2)}]$ by using importance sampling. For simplicity, let us choose the proposal $q(x)=\mathcal{N}(0,3^2) to be a Gaussian with zero mean and standard deviation 3. Argue whether this $q$ is a proper proposal distribution. Use maximum 50 words."
2, 3, "Programming", "Let $X \sim p(x)$ be a random variable following a density $p(x)=\frac{1}{Z}e^{(-x\tanh(x^3))}$ where $Z$ is an unknown constant. Your task is to compute the expectation $E[e^{(-X^2)}]$ by using importance sampling. For simplicity, let us choose the proposal $q(x)=\mathcal{N}(0,3^2) to be a Gaussian with zero mean and standard deviation 3. Provide the code for this. Make sure your code is readable and comment any nontrivial steps."
2, 3, "Essay", "Explain what the burn-in period of Gibbs sampling is. Use maximum 75 words."
